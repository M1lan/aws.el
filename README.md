# aws.el

Under construction, but you can try out what this package tries to achieve by:

   `M-x aws-instances`


You'll see a table-list buffer of AWS instances.

`S` will popup the actions available; start, stop or terminate.

# Requirements

You'll need to have aws-cli installed on your PC, and have it configured so that aws commands are available.
